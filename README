To install ModelTest type the following commands:
$ ./configure [--prefix=INSTALL_DIR]
$ make
$ make install

Set a custom install directory if you don't have root access or you prefer a
different location.

This will compile non-mpi version, and also mpi if available.
Run 'man partest' or 'partest -h' for help.

To compile a Windows executable, install MinGW and run:
$ ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes ac_cv_func_realloc_0_nonnull=yes mingw64-configure
$ make

In case the configure script does not exist, it must be generated using autotools:
$ autoreconf -i
