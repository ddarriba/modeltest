\section{Overview}

{\modeltest} is a tool to carry out statistical selection of best-fit models of nucleotide substitution or amino acid replacement.
It implements five different model selection strategies: hierarchical and dynamical likelihood ratio tests (hLRT and dLRT), Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC), and a decision theory method (DT).
It also provides estimates of model selection uncertainty, parameter importances and model-averaged parameter estimates, including model-averaged tree topologies.
{\modeltest} gathers features of {\em jModelTest 2} \citep{darriba2012} and {\em ProtTest 3} \citep{darriba2011}.

\section{Graphical User Interface}
\label{sec:gui}

\subsection{Launching the Graphical User Interface}

Running {\modeltestguibin} with no arguments launches the graphical interface.
The following window will show on the screen:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{images/main-window}
\end{center}

\begin{tabular}{l p{.7\textwidth}}
  \color{ForestGreen}1 & Load an MSA file in PHYLIP or FASTA format \\
  \color{ForestGreen}2 & Select the phylogenetic tree for each model \\
  \color{ForestGreen}3 & Load a fixed or starting tree in NEWICK format (optional) \\
  \color{ForestGreen}4 & Load a partitioning scheme file in RAxML format (optional) \\
  \color{ForestGreen}5 & Select the number of concurrent threads to use \\
  \color{ForestGreen}6 & Displays the estimated amount of memory needed as a function of the MSA size and the number of threads \\
  \hline
  \color{ForestGreen}7 & Start model selection process \\
  \color{ForestGreen}8 & Save the results report in a file \\
  \color{ForestGreen}9 & Reset the interface \\
  \hline
  \color{RedOrange}10 & Pane containing the main output console \\
  \color{RedOrange}11 & Pane containing data description \\
  \color{RedOrange}12 & Pane containing the model selection configuration \\
  \color{RedOrange}13 & Pane containing the model selection results \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Custom settings}

The settings tab ({\color{RedOrange}12}) allows to change the model optimization settings.
Although the default settings are the most commonly used, you might want to use different ones for your own purposes.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{images/lkl-settings}
\end{center}

\begin{tabular}{l p{.7\textwidth}}
  \color{Blue}1  & Data type (DNA or amino acids) \\
  \color{Blue}2  & Use only models available in a particular phylogenetic inference tool \\
  \color{Blue}3  & Use \emph{a priori} defined subset of substitution schemes \\
  \color{Blue}4  & Correct models for ascertainment bias \\
  \color{Blue}5  & Include models of rate variation among sites \\
  \color{Blue}6  & Select the number of discrete rate categories for Gamma model of rate variation \\
  \color{Blue}7  & Include equal/model-defined or ML/empirical frequencies \\
  \color{Blue}8  & Select individual candidate models \\
  \hline
  \color{Blue}9  & Tolerance for single parameter optimization \\
  \color{Blue}10 & Global tolerance for model optimization \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Example}

If you want to start running a small example, press {\emph Ctrl+O} in the main window.
Select a MSA file from `example-data/nucleic' or `example-data/proteic' in the dialog, either in FASTA or PHYLIP format.
Press {\emph Ctrl+T} and select the corresponding tree file in the dialog, in NEWICK format.
Press {\emph Ctrl+R} and enjoy the execution.

\section{Common Use Cases}

\subsection{Loading Checkpointing Files}
\label{sec:ckp}

\modeltest saves a ``.ckp'' checkpointing files in the log directory. In case of an error occurs,
the user can start again the process minimizing the loss of computation.
If a checkpoint file exists for the input MSA, \modeltest will check if the current arguments
are the same (or compatible) as in the saved search.
If not, it will return an error, because that means that the stored models were evaluated under
different conditions and the results would be inconsistent.
You should then either restart the search with the previous arguments,
or remove the ``.ckp'' file.
